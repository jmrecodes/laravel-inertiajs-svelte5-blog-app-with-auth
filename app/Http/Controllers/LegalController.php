     * TERMS OF SERVICE PAGE
     * ====================
     * 
     * 🎓 LEARNING CONCEPT: Static Content Pages
     * ==========================================
     * 
     * This method demonstrates:
     * - Simple controller method for static content
     * - Returning Inertia responses to render Svelte components
     * - Passing minimal data (just auth state) to legal pages
     * - Clean, readable controller structure
     * 
     * Why Terms of Service pages are important:
     * - Define rules and expectations for users
     * - Protect your application from misuse
     * - Establish legal boundaries and responsibilities
     * - Required for most commercial applications
     * 
     * Route: GET /terms
     * Component: Legal/Terms.svelte
     * 
     * @return Response The Inertia response rendering the Terms page
     */

         * INERTIA RENDER PATTERN
         * ======================
         * 
         * What's happening here:
         * 1. Inertia::render() tells Laravel to render a Svelte component
         * 2. 'Legal/Terms' refers to resources/js/Pages/Legal/Terms.svelte
         * 3. We pass minimal data - auth is handled by middleware
         * 4. The component receives this data as props
         * 
         * Beginner Note: This is the standard pattern for all Inertia page responses!

    /**
     * PRIVACY POLICY PAGE
     * ===================
     * 
     * 🎓 LEARNING CONCEPT: Privacy Compliance
     * =======================================
     * 
     * This method demonstrates:
     * - How to handle privacy policy pages
     * - Legal requirements for data collection
     * - User rights and data protection
     * - Transparency in data handling
     * 
     * Why Privacy Policy pages are crucial:
     * - Required by GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy laws
     * - Explain how user data is collected and used
     * - Build user trust through transparency
     * - Protect your organization legally
     * - Enable users to make informed decisions
     * 
     * Educational considerations:
     * - Even learning projects should demonstrate proper privacy practices
     * - Shows students how to handle user data responsibly
     * - Templates real-world legal requirements
     * 
     * Route: GET /privacy
     * Component: Legal/Privacy.svelte
     * 
     * @return Response The Inertia response rendering the Privacy Policy page
     */

        /*
         * MINIMAL DATA PASSING
         * ====================
         * 
         * Legal pages typically need minimal server-side data:
         * - Authentication state (handled by middleware)
         * - Maybe some contact information or company details
         * - Current date for "last updated" information
         * 
         * We could pass additional data here if needed:
         * 
         * return Inertia::render('Legal/Privacy', [
         *     'lastUpdated' => '2025-01-01',
         *     'contactEmail' => 'legal@example.com',
         *     'companyName' => 'Educational Blog'
         * ]);
         * 
         * But for this educational example, we keep it simple.

    }

    /**
     * FUTURE ENHANCEMENT SUGGESTIONS
     * ==============================
     * 
     * For more advanced legal page handling, you might consider:
     * 
     * 1. VERSIONING: Track different versions of legal documents
     *    - Store in database with version numbers
     *    - Show users when terms have changed
     *    - Require acknowledgment of updates
     * 
     * 2. DYNAMIC CONTENT: Load legal content from database/CMS
     *    - Allow non-technical team members to update content
     *    - Version control for legal document changes
     *    - A/B testing for different legal language
     * 
     * 3. USER ACCEPTANCE TRACKING: Record when users accept terms
     *    - Log acceptance in database with timestamps
     *    - Track which version was accepted
     *    - Enable re-acceptance when terms change
     * 
     * 4. INTERNATIONALIZATION: Multiple language versions
     *    - Different legal requirements by country
     *    - Translated terms and privacy policies
     *    - Jurisdiction-specific legal text
     * 
     * Example method for dynamic content:
     * 
     * public function termsWithVersions(): Response
     * {
     *     $currentTerms = LegalDocument::where('type', 'terms')
     *         ->where('is_active', true)
     *         ->latest()
     *         ->first();
     * 
     *     return Inertia::render('Legal/Terms', [
     *         'document' => $currentTerms,
     *         'lastUpdated' => $currentTerms->updated_at,
     *         'version' => $currentTerms->version
     *     ]);
     * }
     * 
     * These patterns are common in production applications but beyond
     * the scope of this educational demonstration.
