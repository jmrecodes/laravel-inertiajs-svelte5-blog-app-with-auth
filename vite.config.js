/**
 * VITE CONFIGURATION - MODERN BUILD TOOL SETUP FOR EDUCATIONAL APP
 * ================================================================
 * 
 * Vite is a fast and modern build tool that serves as the bridge between our
 * Laravel backend and Svelte frontend. It handles the process of compiling
 * our JavaScript and CSS assets for both development and production.
 * 
 * üéì BEGINNER LEARNING OBJECTIVES:
 * ================================
 * 1. **Build Tools**: Understanding the role of Vite in a modern web development workflow.
 * 2. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Experiencing instant UI updates during development.
 * 3. **Asset Bundling**: How JavaScript and CSS files are processed and optimized.
 * 4. **Plugin System**: Extending Vite's capabilities with specific framework integrations.
 * 5. **Development vs. Production**: Different configurations for different environments.
 * 
 * üîç WHAT YOU'LL LEARN:
 * =====================
 * - How to configure Vite for a Laravel and Svelte project.
 * - The purpose of the `laravel-vite-plugin` for backend integration.
 * - The role of `@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte` for Svelte 5 compilation.
 * - How `tailwindcss/vite` simplifies Tailwind CSS setup.
 * - Optimizing production builds with `rollupOptions` (code splitting).
 * - Setting up path aliases for cleaner imports.

         * ==================
         * 
         * This plugin creates the crucial bridge between your Laravel backend and Vite frontend.
         * It tells Laravel where your frontend assets are located and handles asset refreshing.
         * 
         * üîç WHAT IT DOES:
         * - **Generates correct asset URLs**: Ensures Laravel correctly links to your Vite-processed assets.
         * - **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Enables instant browser updates without full page reloads during development.
         * - **Manages asset manifest**: In production, it creates a manifest file for versioning and caching.
         *
         * `input`: An array specifying the main entry points (your primary JavaScript and CSS files).
         * `refresh`: Enables browser auto-reloading when certain files change (e.g., Blade templates).
