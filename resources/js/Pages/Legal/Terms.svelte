   * IMPORTS AND DEPENDENCIES - SVELTE 5 + INERTIA.JS
   * ================================================
   * 
   * We import the `Link` component from Inertia.js for client-side navigation.
   * üéì LEARN: Why `Link` components are preferred over standard `<a>` tags in Inertia.js apps.
   */

  /*
   * COMPONENT PROPS - DATA FROM LARAVEL CONTROLLER
   * ==============================================
   * 
   * These properties are passed to this Svelte component from the
   * `LegalController::terms()` method. In this case, we only expect shared data
   * like `auth` (authentication status), as legal pages are mostly static.
   * 
   * üéì LEARN: How minimal data flows from Laravel (backend) to Svelte (frontend).

<!--
  DYNAMIC PAGE HEAD - SEO OPTIMIZATION FOR LEGAL PAGES
  ====================================================
  
  `<svelte:head>` is used to set page-specific meta tags for search engines and browser tabs.
  For legal documents, we typically set `noindex, nofollow` to prevent search engines from indexing
  these pages, as they are not primary content for search results.
  
  üéì LEARN: How `<svelte:head>` manages dynamic HTML `<head>` content and `robots` directives.

<!--
  MAIN CONTENT LAYOUT CONTAINER - OVERALL PAGE STRUCTURE
  ======================================================
  
  This `div` defines the main structure and background for the Terms of Service page,
  applying a minimum height and background color for a consistent look.
  It uses responsive design principles with Tailwind CSS utilities.

<div class="min-h-screen bg-gray-50">
  <!-- 
    HEADER NAVIGATION BAR - CONSISTENT SITE NAVIGATION

    Its presence ensures users can easily navigate back to the main application.
